# Shops
Shops (With working coffee and sodamachine, plus some hotdog/burger stands)


Modification of ESX_Shops

Shops no longer have visible blips, just enter the shop and approach checkin counter to open the shop.
Also all soda, coffee and snack machines are now working (per model, so any you can find). (Approach the machines).

Some hotdog and hamburger stands are also working.

Just add what you want under the name for those shops in sql database.
